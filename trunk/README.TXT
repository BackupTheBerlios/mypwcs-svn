MyPWAuthenticatorCS is a .NET/Mono DLL that allows easy use of MyPW in 
your own applications.

Please see the source in MyPWTester to see how to use this DLL.

Also, note that this was created on Mono with MonoDevelop.   The binary DLLs
should work on MS .NET 2.0.  I have not created solution/project files for 
use with MS Visual Studio 2005. It should be trival for someone with access to 
Visual Studio 2005 to create the project/solution file.

This code is still alpha quality.  It is functional, but still needs some work.

MyPWAuthenticatorCS currently includes a slightly modified version of XmlRpcCS, 
http://xmlrpccs.sourceforge.net/ by Nicholas Christopher. The source for this 
XmlRpcCS version is in the xmlrpc/ directory.
