MyPWAuthenticatorCS is a .NET/Mono DLL that allows easy use of MyPW in 
your own applications.

Please see the source in MyPWTester to see how to use this DLL.

Also, note that this was created on Mono with MonoDevelop.   The binary DLLs
should work on MS .NET 2.0, but at this time I have not create solution/project
files for use with MS Visual Studio 2005. It should be trival for someone with 
access to Visual Studio 2005 to create the project/solution file.


This code is still alpha quality.  It is functional, but still needs some work.
