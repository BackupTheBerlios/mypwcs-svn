Currently, in order to build MyPWAuthenticatorCS you will need to have Mono 1.2.3+ 
and MonoDevelop installed.

Using MonoDevelop, open the "MyPWAuthenticatorCS.mdp" file, which is in the same 
directory as this "BUILD.txt" file.  Once it has been loaded, press the "F8" key
to build the solution.
 
You can also press the "F5" key to run the MyPWTester application to see if everything
works.

In the near future, NAnt will be used to simplify building on both Mono and Microsoft
.NET 2.0 environments.
